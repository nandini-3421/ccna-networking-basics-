# Network Topologies

## 1. Bus Topology
- Single backbone cable
- Cheap but unreliable

## 2. Star Topology
- Central switch
- Most common topology

## 3. Ring Topology
- Circular data flow
- Rarely used today

## 4. Mesh Topology
- Multiple paths
- Highly reliable

## 5. Hybrid Topology
- Combination of topologies
